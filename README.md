# Billing Things

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript workspace for the "Billing Things" mobile-first ERP UI.

Get started:

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The UI uses Tailwind classes; Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
- The app entry is `src/main.tsx` which mounts the existing `App.tsx` at the repository root.
